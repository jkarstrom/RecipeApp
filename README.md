# Recipe App
## Used React Native and other things :)

#### Libraries used are listed in dependencies. 

#### This exercise was to understand navigation in React Native better when building applications, specifically on iOS. Learning how to implement different libraries as well was very interesting. I will continue working on the project to expand on it. 

#### Known Errors: The CSS will not work on the home screen, only the welcome screen and the recipe detail screen.
